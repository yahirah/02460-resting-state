% In the case of ICA decomposition, the independent component filters are
% chosen to produce the maximally temporally independent signals available
% in the channel data. These are, in effect, information sources in the
% data whose mixtures, via volume conduction, have been recorded at the
% scalp channels. The mixing process (for EEG, by volume conduction) is
% passive, linear, and adds no information to the data. On the contrary,
% it mixes and obscures the functionally distinct and independent
% source contributions.

% We are satisfied that Infomax ICA (runica/binica) gives stable decompositions with up to hundreds of channels

% ICA components of EEG data are maximally temporally independent,
% but spatially unconstrained -- and therefore able to find maps representing
% the projection of a partially synchronized domain / island / patch / region of cortex,
% no matter how much it may overlap the projections of other (relatively independent) EEG sources.

%% Studying and removing ICA components
% Tools > Reject data using ICA > Reject components by map

%  Component property figures can also be accessed directly by selecting Plot > Component properties.
% (There is an equivalent menu item for channels, Plot > Channel properties).
% Artifactual components are also relatively easy to identify by visual inspection of
% component time course (menu Plot > Component activations (scroll)

% Component activations (time courses), select Plot > Component activations (scroll)

% dim(X) = [electrodes , time]
% A = loadings (coordinate system) (mixing to go back to X)
% dim(A) = [electrodes , components]
% S = latent (underlying latent variables/factors) (components)
% dim(S) = [components , time]

% activity of e.g. the 2nd component is found by the 2nd row of S and 2nd
% column of A
% A[:,2] * S[2,:] = XC2

% XC2 =  where is component 2 active (in the brain)
% S[2,:] = when is component 2 active

% Columns of the A matrix which are the scalp projection of the components
% Rows of the S matrix which are the time course of the component activity

% Now, if one want to remove component number 2 from the data (for instance if component number 2 proved to be an artifact),
% one can simply subtract the matrix above (XC2) from the original data X.
