permutation test
experiments:
    length of microstate intervals as a function of (n of preICA microstates), measure: median of distribution
    similarity of microstates as a function of (n of preICA microstates) (similarity: match up microstates by how much variance they explain)
    similarity of microstates as a function of different ICA approximation functions

eeg: mixture of signals with different kurtosis

exam:
have questions with answers prepared.
have notes with additional figures
send a copy of the poster to Lars monday afternoon
